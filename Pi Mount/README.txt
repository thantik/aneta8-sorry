# Summary

This is a remix of the Raspberry Pi 3 with camera mount for the back of the LCD panel on the Anet A8 here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2185490 

@bma801did a great job and he said he does not even have a pi3. 

After I starting putting an actual pi3 install in place, I needed  the following improvements:

- Added a slot cutout into the top cover for the camera cable 

- Changed the camera to have TWO hinge connectors instead of three.  The three on three was difficult to connect because they were off-center, and because they were too thick.  I replaced the original three on the camera back, with two thinner ones more like the extension arms he had designed.  The three arm camera back is still recommended if you are using the extensions though and still included in the zip.

# Post-Printing

## - I used an M3 screw through the holes in the arms and nut to connect the camera and body.
